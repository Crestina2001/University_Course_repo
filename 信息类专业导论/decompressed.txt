Reflection
Hello everyone, the speaker uses the example of the invention of programmable computers, whose inspiration comes from musical instruments, to demonstrate that even seemingly frivolous amusement can be converted into tech revolution. In my perspective, however, even though the sparks of inspiration can be an outcome of entertainment, implement of the idea and popularity of the invention is determined by its feasibility and its virtual usage.
Even though some specific steps of a great invention may be inspired by something useless in our life, most steps of the invention are the product of utilitarian and purposeful seek. Take the invention of computer for instance, although initially the idea of triggering letters with keyboards came from the flute and thought of automation from music box, most of its development steps were based on human's needs. In the beginning, people invented the computers to fulfil the calculation efficiently. Later on, with the befalling of second world war and subsequent cold war, people desired to crack wartime codes and calculate rocket trajectories, giving rise to the born of early giant computers. Need to mention, computers have principles much more sophisticated than our imagination and most of the principles are based on mathematics and physics, which are tedious but useful. Among these, the triggering of letters with keyboard and mere thought of automation mentioned in the speech are only exceedingly minimal parts of them. 
Therefore, in most cases, an amusement not serious in any way is just an amusement. If you do want to make an invention, you should be grounded on human's needs and have an explicit purpose, instead of wandering about with a delusion that some preposterous ideas will change the world !
